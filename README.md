# One-piece-api

This is a rest API built using Node js(express) and MongoDB. It's the back-end of my larger project, (the One-piece encyclopedia)[https://github.com/marzouk2002/One-piece-encyclopedia].
It handles serving JSON and static files, also user-related stuff like login, register, and comments.
